Slay the Spire March 15th Daily - Watcher | When you get lots of cards, it's hard to draw right ones

Hi All! This is my attempt at the March 15th Daily with the Watcher. The run starts at 3:36.
The modifiers for this daily are:

1. Chimera: Your starting deck is a fusion of 3 characters (3x Strike, 3x Defend, 1x Bash, 1x Survivor, 1x Zap, 1x Eruption).
2. Time Dilation: All enemies start with the Slow debuff.
3. Night Terrors: Resting at Rest Sites heals 100% of your HP, but costs 5 max HP.

My final score was 1414, which was ok. I perfected 7/8 possible Elites and 2/3 of the bosses.

Slay the Spire is a game created and developed by Mega Crit Games. An Early Access version was released in November 2017, and was updated almost weekly until the full release on January 23, 2019. Version 2.0 was released on January 14, 2020, which included many added relics, potions, and most importantly, the fourth character.

"We fused card games and roguelikes together to make the best single player deckbuilder we could. Craft a unique deck, encounter bizarre creatures, discover relics of immense power, and Slay the Spire!" - Steam Store Page (https://store.steampowered.com/app/64...)
